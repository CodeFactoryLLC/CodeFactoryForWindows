# ViewDialog Updates
In this release the default styles that are loaded in visual studio are implemented on the standard wpf controls.
This allows users content windows to following the style in visual studio.

# Extension Shell Commands
Only two extension shell commands are now displayed. The documentation extensions will be added back in an upcoming release. 

# Command Notifications
